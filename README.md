# Honkai VNs
Structured translations of HI3 VNs so that they can be loaded in to VN via userscripts, extensions, standalone versions, etc.

* Anti-Entropy: https://zklm.github.io/honkai-vn-antientropy/ (Standalone)
* Durandal: https://zklm.github.io/honkai-vn-durandal/ (Standalone)

## Translators
The goal is to give contributor permissions of this repo to any active competent translator. Userscripts and so on would all then query from here to load translations. Full credit given of course. If anyone's keen, I guess just submit an issue, lemme know if you wanna discuss through email/whatever.

Translating is fairly straightforward, in each VN directory there's a CN xml and EN xml directory, it just involves updating the files in EN xml directory. EN xml files will have CN text by default until they're translated to make it easier.

For corrections and minor translations, feel free to submit an issue or PR.

## Consistency
Translations acquired from other sources are only modified to fix typos and to use official EN names over literal translations. 

Examples of official EN name changes:
* Destiny/Fate -> Schicksal
* Jorgunmand -> World Serpent
* Atagina -> Ataegina

For transparency, modified translations will have a comment alongside them containing the original line.

## Current Progress
* Durandal: CH1-8 done (Aiatar), C9-31 untranslated
* Anti-Entropy: CH1-12 untranslated, CH13-26 mostly done (Aiatar)
* Seven Swords: 0
