            <text>The Azores Islands, located at the center of the North Atlantic Ocean, are populated by hundreds of thousands of people in the real world.</text>
            <text>However, here in this world within the Quantum Sea—— The crew of the 「Caledonia」 arrived at an uninhabited island.</text>
            <text>The sea breeze made its presence known in the quiet forest, letting them feel the beauty of nature that transcended all solitude and desolateness.</text>
            <text>Shakespeare stopped at the cape.</text>
            <text>She took the jar from Bianka's hands, and the sound of 「splash」 signaled that it had hit its mark.</text>
            <text>After surprising Bianka, Shakespeare took a letter out of her pocket and began reading it.</text>
            <speak chara="_Shakespeare">「Physcian, heal thyself: then wilt thou also heal thy patient.」</speak>
            <speak chara="_Shakespeare">「A thousand paths are there which have never yet been trodden; a thousand salubrities and hidden islands of life.」</speak>
            <speak chara="_Shakespeare">「Your dream, a bold sailor, half-ship, half-hurricane. I stood silently on the shore, facing the sea you willingly sailed to.」</speak>
            <speak chara="_Shakespeare">「When the devil casts his skin, does not his name also fall away? On the other side of the shore nothing is true, all is permitted.」</speak>
            <speak chara="_Shakespeare">「Farewell, my friend, my enemy. Amen.」</speak>
            <text>She put her hands together, and threw the letter into the sea.</text>
