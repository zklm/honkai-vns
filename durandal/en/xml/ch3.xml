            <text>The 「Quantum Sea」 is not a real ocean.</text>
            <text>It doesn't belong to any particular planet, nor it's composed of liquid such as water.</text>
            <text>It's not the 「cornerstone」 of a 「single universe」 either, but the 「medium」 where many worlds of countless possibilities exist.</text>
            <text>Its structure can't be completely described using a third or four dimensional mathematical concept——</text>
            <text>Let's imagine for a moment many worlds, each one with their own set of dimensions and laws, being their own separated 「bubble world」——</text>
            <text>——Following that metaphor, the 「Quantum Sea」 is an 「ocean」 that houses countless 「bubble worlds」.</text>
            <text>...Of course, it doesn't matter if you think of it as a bathtub instead of an ocean.</text>
            <text>「Membranes」 are formed in the 「fluctuations」 of the 「Ether」 the 「Quantum Sea」 is composed of, and said 「membranes」 may evolve into a 「bubble world」.</text>
            <text>As we all know, a three dimensional bubble has a spherical surface that is close to being two dimensional.</text>
            <text>When these 「bubble worlds」 are in the 「Ether Bathhub」, a choice of which of the eleven dimensions are inherited must be made.</text>
            <text>For instance, in the 「universe」 we are familiar with humans can recognize four dimension and seven extra dimensions, each one being a constant 「membrane」.</text>
            <text>What Bishop Otto referred to as 「Ether Anchor Point」 is the special structure or method that allows those 「membranes」 to turn into 「bubble worlds」.</text>
            <text>When the 「analogous distance」 between two 「membranes」 is small enough, they begin to influence each other—— For example, by exchanging matter.</text>
            <text>Speaking in general, it's easier for a substance to go from a 「relatively small membrane」 to a 「relatively big membrane」 but doing the oppossite is quite difficult——</text>
            <text>——As such, the 「relatively small membrane」 is likely to be the one who performs changes to other bigger 「membranes」.</text>
            <text>And finally, the special 「membrane」 called 「projection」 is born.</text>
            <text>In this 「projection」, only analogous areas of the 「membranes」 continue to exist—— while everything else disappears completely.</text>
            <text>For example, the 「world」 where the 「Caledonia」 exists right now is a 「projection」 made out of 「membranes」 which had analogous properties between them.</text>
            <text>This is how Bianka and Rita were able to meet 「Captain Shakespeare」 who came from another world.</text>

                <p class="article-text">海峡被截断、地中海和大西洋断绝联系的事件，在地质史上真实发生过。以下内容引自《古海荒漠：科学史上大发现》一书（许靖华著，朱文焕译，生活·读书·新知三联书店、天下文化出版公司出版）：</p>
                <br />
                <p class="article-text">***地中海的沧桑史***</p>
                <p class="article-text">我们设想：在2000万年前，地中海是一条联通印度洋和大西洋的宽阔海路。大约1500万年前，随着非洲和欧亚大陆的碰撞和在中东发生的造山运动，古地中海与印度洋的海路联系宣告中断。当时，古地中海与大西洋联系的通道也仅遗留下两条狭窄的海峡——西班牙南部的贝蒂克（Betic）海峡和北非的里菲（Riphian）海峡。我们在岩芯里可以清楚地看出地中海环境的逐步恶化——海水流动渐趋停滞，底栖生物不可避免地纷纷死亡，浮游种群苟延残喘，而幸免于盐度危机的耐盐种族则演化繁衍。随着两条海峡的最后封闭，这个内陆海变成了一些巨大的盐湖。盐湖不断涸竭，导致这个位于海平面以下3000公尺的中新世“死谷”底上的动植物荡然无存。直布罗陀地峡是一道孤孤单单的长堤，横亘在干涸的地中海和大西洋之间的咽喉地带，阻止了大西洋海水的侵入。500万年前的上新世初叶，这道长堤决口，破堤而入的海水汹涌奔腾，冲过缺口，形成一个巨大的瀑布。这个直布罗陀大瀑布的水流量每年约为四万立方公里，比维多利亚瀑布壮观百倍，比尼亚加拉瀑布雄浑千倍。但即使是这样大的瀑布，也需要一百多年才能把干涸的地中海重新灌满海水。这该是何等壮观的场面啊！</p>
                <p class="article-text">在墨西拿盐度危机时期，一旦海水溢过地峡，动物也会随之蜂拥而来；而一旦溶解的离子以盐的形式沉淀下来，它们就又都死亡殆尽。但是，每一次洪水泛滥后就会建立起一代新的动物王朝。上新世初，直布罗陀海峡又窄又深，大西洋的冷海水可以畅通无阻地流入新诞生的地中海。但是，岩芯已经告诉我们，历史是会重演的。目前，直布罗陀海峡正在变浅而成为一道海槛。我们可以设想，总有一天，直布罗陀海峡又会重新变成阻隔在大西洋和地中海沙漠之间的一条地峡。</p>
                <p class="article-text">这个故事委实过于离奇，但是雷恩、希妲和我是根据岩芯的分析资料推论出来的，可谓证据确凿。我们这个大胆的见解自然遭到许多人的怀疑。质疑者有之，批评者亦不乏其人。但是，由诘问和答辩组成的每一个回合，到头来不过是在帮助我们，在这幅拼图游戏中又翻开了一些新的拼版而已。</p>
