            <text>Bianka Ataegina kept quiet and let herself be swayed by the movement of the truck.</text>

            <text>He isn't a talkative person in the first place.</text>
            <text>Which made the already strange conclusion to this case make her feel like she had something stuck in the back of her throat.</text>
            <text>Deep inside that facility, Bianka found a boy and a girl in an unexpected mood.</text>
            <text>The boy's name was Jimmy, and the girl's name was Alice.</text>
            <text>Despite being kidnapped, Jimmy didn't show any joy when he was rescued by Bianka and the rest of his crew.</text>
            <text>He said nothing, and with a serious look on his face, he handed over a document to Bianka.</text>
            <text>The document was signed by the 「President of the City Administration Group」. It detailed how a team under her orders was able to take control of the facility before the ground team did, and instructions on what to do with the girl and the facility.</text>
            <text>That girl saved Jimmy's life, but she is also a suspect who let people that could have been saved die. And on top of that, she's guilty of causing this incident.</text>
            <text>...No, that's wrong. She should be considered innocent.</text>
            <text>After all, she's just a mere computer.</text>

            <text>Could it be——</text>
