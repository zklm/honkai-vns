            <show chara="faustSadClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">...But in that aspect I'm different from you.</speak>
            <show chara="faustTalkClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">Is this world a dream? An illusion? Or perhaps a place between heaven and hell?</speak>
            <show chara="faustLaughClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">——Why would any of that matter to 「me」?</speak>
            <show chara="faustSmileClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">「I」 think, therefore 「I」 exist, and as long as 「I」 exist, the world is 「real」.</speak>
            <show chara="faustTalkClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">It's only a philosophical answer—— But that's enough for me.</speak>
            <show chara="faustTalkClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">The external 「reality」 is not something that can be absolutely proven compared to the concept of 「I」 that everyone can understand.</speak>
            <show chara="faustSadClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">My 「I」 and someone else's 「I」 cannot confirm each other's existence.</speak>
            <show chara="faustTalkClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">For instance, you are standing in front of me. How can I know that? Because my five senses are conveying me the information 「Shelley is there」.</speak>
            <show chara="faustTalkClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">However, it's not logically possible to ascertain that 「Shelley is thinking」 with only sensory information.</speak>
            <show chara="faustSmileClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">One can use the Turing Test as a metric to 「conclude」 that 「Shelley is thinking」 but——</speak>
            <show chara="faustSadClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">That 「conclusion」 is ultimately a 「deduction」. It's impossible to ever determine whether you're the Shelley I know or a replica of her.</speak>
            <show chara="faustTalkClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">It's a paradox. From the point of view of my 「I」, the 「Objective Cognition」 is the most 「subjective」 of all.</speak>
            <show chara="faustTalkClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">In Objectivism, an observer speaks only of 「causality」 and 「conclusion」—— While disregarding the asymmetric 「existence property」 of 「self」 and 「other selves」.</speak>
            <show chara="faustSmileClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">...Then should we in turn support Subjectivism?</speak>
            <show chara="faustSadClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">The answer is, of course, a rotund no. That would be like throwing away a correct and great thing due to a small mistake.</speak>
            <show chara="faustTalkClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">We humans rely on continuous technological advancements to evolve. Technology has taken us from barbaric monkeys—— To a splendid civilization.</speak>
            <show chara="faustTalkClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">Technology is the only thing that can foster human progress. And technology stands on the side of thorough Objectivism.</speak>
            <show chara="faustTalkClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">Rather than simply ignoring philosophy, technology is more than happy to throw it away——</speak>
            <show chara="faustSmileClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">——But that's precisely why technology born of thought can free itself from it to take us to higher heights.</speak>
            <show chara="faustTalkClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">In short, based on Objectivism there is no choice but to find a breakthrough for 「I」 in the gap between 「observation」 and 「cognition」.</speak>
            <show chara="faustTalkClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">Cognitive asymmetry exists because we only have the means to recognize our own 「self」 and not 「other selves」.</speak>
            <show chara="faustSadClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">On the outside, there is a physical gap separating each consciousness, but it's impossible for a 「direct cognition」 such as 「I exist」 to surpass the 「self」.</speak>
            <show chara="faustSmileClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">However——</speak>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">——What if everyone worked together to turn every 「other selves」 into a 「self」?</speak>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">Wouldn't that fundamentally get rid of the problem?</speak>

            <show chara="shelleyAngryClose" position="left"/>
            <speak chara="_Shelley">...Do you realize what you're saying? You designed the 「Brain Engine」 for that reason?</speak>
            <show chara="shelleyAngryClose" position="left" opacity="0.8"/>
            <show chara="faustLaughClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">Hmph. Of course I know—— And I believe I can make you understand as well.</speak>
            <show chara="faustSmileClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">The Brain Engine passed the Turing Test—— Just like your 「jewel」.</speak>

            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">We both know a 「machine」 that can pass the Turing Test is self-aware, just like you and I.</speak>
            <show chara="faustSmileClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">So where did the 「new consciousness」 of the Brain Engine come from?</speak>
            <show chara="faustSadClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">And assuming it was born out of nothing, where did the original consciousnesses go to?</speak>
            <show chara="faustTalkClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">If they didn't go anywhere, which brain is in control of the distributed system?</speak>
            <show chara="faustSmileClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">When all these questions can't be answered, there is only one reasonable conclusion.</speak>
            <show chara="faustTalkClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">That is...</speak>
            <show chara="faustSmileClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">The many consciousness of the brains have 「fused」.</speak>
            <show chara="faustLaughClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">Do you think it's preposterous? But if you think about it, each brain is made of countless brain cells.</speak>
            <show chara="faustLaughClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">Wouldn't that make our own existence absurd? Are we machines without a subjective consciousness too?</speak>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">「I think, therefore I am」. No one would believe they don't have a subjective consciousness.</speak>
            <show chara="faustTalkClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">We can be certain of that because we are aware of that micro structure——</speak>
            <show chara="faustSmileClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">——The so called 「soul」 is not an isolated and absolute 「something」. It's a 「conceptual honeycomb」 that brings together all systems capable of information exchange to a certain degree.</speak>
            <show chara="faustTalkClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">For example, the cerebral cortex doesn't collapse immediately after a part of it is cut off. On the contrary, the rest are able to take over the missing part's tasks. Not to mention——</speak>
            <show chara="faustSmileClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">——If the cerebral cortex were to be split in two it would result in two independent personalities being born.</speak>
            <show chara="faustSadClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">Then what happens if the halves are reattached? Would you say the two new independent personalities were 「killed」, and that the old personality was 「revived」?</speak>
            <show chara="faustSmileClose" position="right"/>
            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">These philosophical problems become easy to solve when we assume the 「subjective consciousness」 has the ability to split and merge.</speak>

            <speak chara="_FaustNoName">And if that hypothesis is correct, the path humanity needs to take to achieve 「transcendence」 becomes clear.</speak>
            <show chara="faustSmileClose" position="right"/>
