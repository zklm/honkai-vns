                <p class="article-text">法式千层酥（mille-feuille）是由三层酥皮夹两层奶油或果酱制成的一类蛋糕，其发明灵感可能源自那不勒斯的披萨。</p>

                <p class="article-text-h">Note：</p>
                <p class="article-text">米格尔·德·塞万提斯·萨维德拉（Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, 1547 ~ 1616）是西班牙文学世界里最伟大的作家，甚至连西班牙语都被称为“塞万提斯的语言”。他的《堂吉诃德》，被认为是文学史上的第一部“现代小说”。</p>
                <p class="article-text">塞万提斯曾作为普通军人参加了1571年10月7日的勒班陀战役。在八年后撰写的一项官方报告中这样写道：“……在这场海战中，塞万提斯发着高烧，状态很差，连长和战友告诉他：你的情况很糟糕，应该好好躺在帆船的房间里。塞万提斯指责道：你们说什么呢，我没有尽到我应尽的义务，与其当怕死鬼，倒宁愿为了上帝和国王而战死……他就这样与战友们一起，像连长所命令的那样，在这场战斗中和土耳其人搏斗着。战斗结束后，胡安将军知晓了他的英勇表现，给了他额外的四个金币……在这场战役中，他的胸部和手部两处受伤，他的左手从此残废了。”</p>
