            <speak chara="_AliceGreen">The Professor and his assistants wanted to use me to destroy the city that expelled them.</speak>
            <speak chara="_AliceGreen">They wanted to decode and hijack the city's communication system wirelessly to destroy them with the robots they are so proud of.</speak>

            <speak chara="_AliceGreen">To them, this 「Alice」 personality must have been nothing but a decoration to the 「Alice」 interface, as if they were playing with a doll.</speak>
            <speak chara="_AliceGreen">Because 「I」 am completely unnecessary—— For what 「I」 was truly made for.</speak>

            <speak chara="_AliceGreen">I wonder if all humans use their own children this way, Jimmy-san.</speak>
