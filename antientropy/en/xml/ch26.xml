                <p class="article-text">于是，很多年后，当一位哲学家前来参观的时候，船上的所有部件，都已经换过至少两次了。</p>

            <speak chara="johnSmithNoFace">As someone from Brooklyn... I take pride on what we accomplished. We managed to rebuild that building.</speak>
            <speak chara="johnSmithNoFace">The former Empire State Building—— Now known as Welt Obelisk.</speak>
            <speak chara="johnSmithNoFace">Now I truly feel like Manhattan is back.</speak>
            <speak chara="newsNoFace">Welt Obelisk is the result of the skyscraper restoration project by ME Company. The design follows the 1930 version of the Empire State Building to the letter.</speak>
            <speak chara="newsNoFace">General Mechatronics went through rough times after the 「Thanksgiving Disaster」, but now reborn as ME Company they've become one of the Fortune 500 companies in the world.</speak>
            <speak chara="newsNoFace">As a New York citizen and a ME Company employee, John Smith's job must have not been easy. I think this can't be summarized solely with "I became stronger"</speak>
            <speak chara="johnSmithNoFace">At the time I was just an electrician in charge of the building's security.</speak>
            <speak chara="johnSmithNoFace">Then suddenly the security guard on duty started banging on my door.</speak>
            <speak chara="johnSmithNoFace">I was sleeping and he pulled me out to the street while I was still wearing my pajamas.</speak>
            <speak chara="johnSmithNoFace">That's when I realized the city's electric network wasn't working.</speak>
            <speak chara="newsNoFace">Amid the confusion and danger, John Smith inspected every corner of the building to make sure there weren't any potential risks.</speak>
            <speak chara="johnSmithNoFace">We just followed the manual, really. We couldn't act on our own after being suddenly thrown in a situation like that, we could only do our best while following the emergency procedures.</speak>
            <speak chara="johnSmithNoFace">But I gotta give thanks to everyone who was in the building, they respected our instructions and evacuated the building without panicking.</speak>
            <speak chara="johnSmithNoFace">Otherwise it would had been impossible for the building to collapse and still have 「zero casualties」.</speak>
            <speak chara="newsNoFace">As everyone knows, the Empire State Building was hit by a sudden meteorite at noon and was destroyed one hour later.</speak>
            <speak chara="newsNoFace">According to the experts most of the meteorites from the 「Thanksgiving Disaster」 evaporated in the atmosphere——</speak>
            <speak chara="newsNoFace">Except for the meteorite that fell in Raritan Bay, this is the only building damaged in New York.</speak>

            <speak chara="yangNoFace">Einstein and Tesla... had their bodies permanently changed.</speak>
            <speak chara="yangNoFace">And I inherited the core of the 1st Herrscher as I was the only person fit for it.</speak>
            <speak chara="yangNoFace">So in that sense, I'm not the original 1st Herrscher.</speak>
