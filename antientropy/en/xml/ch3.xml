            <text>Compared to the tidy and orderly ground floor, the private space on the top floor is quite simply Hell on Earth.</text>
            <text>A few minutes ago, Welt would never have predicted that he would find these items outside a girl's bedroom  — </text>
            <text>Pizza boxes piled together like Jenga.</text>

            <text>Wastepaper piled into bins and forming trash heaps the size of small mountains.</text>
            <text>Bras, undergarments and stockings, hang-drying everywhere.</text>
            <text>Mysterious electronic devices discarded and tossed against a corner, their surfaces covered with dust.</text>
            <text>It's hard to imagine how: but perhaps because the cleaners won't come upstairs, everything has now turned into this hair-raising spectacle.</text>
            <text>Now if we were to confirm, with the tiniest, most remote possibilty, that this scene is actually typical for private residences of countless single ladies everywhere — god knows how many gentlemen will be left shellshocked and heartbroken?</text>
            <text>At least, right now, Welt is searching for Room 203 with a heavy heart.</text>

            <text>Welt had heard this term before while he was in the previous labs.</text>
            <text>According to conclusions drawn from ancient manuscripts, when the instantaneous power output of a Honkai eruption reaches over 1000HW, there is a chance for an existence called a “Herrscher” to be born within the disaster zone.</text>
            <text>The “Herrscher” is a monster transformed from a human who is highly adaptable to Honkai Energy — </text>
            <text> — These women can use the supernatural power originating from the “Core of the Herrscher” to destroy the human world with impunity.</text>
            <text>Yes, “women”. More than a dozen Herrschers had been recorded in ancient literature, and with no exceptions, all of them were female.</text>
            <text>Generally speaking, the adaptability of males to Honkai Energy is much lower than that of females —  and the Herrscher is the ultimate manifestation of that adaptability.</text>

            <text>There are no Herrschers in the world today. Also, those various statements referring to them in ancient literature may be nothing more than crude creation myths.</text>
