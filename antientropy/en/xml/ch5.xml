                <p class="article-text" style="color:rgb(181,233,247);">The second law of thermodynamics can be formulated as follows: if the entropy of a system decreases, it will inevitably cause the entropy of another system to rise by a greater margin. From the perspective of information theory, this is equivalent to the huge information asymmetry between the ordinary environment where information is highly chaotic, and the negative entropic environment where information is highly ordered. Historically, research has shown that Honkai energy and this information asymmetry have a strong inter-relationship. Mathematically, the imaginary internal energy belongs to the collapsing, convergent manifold, while the so-called divergent manifold — that is, the four-dimensional space-time that we can usually perceive — contains the thermodynamic manifestation of the “real internal energy”; together these can be mathematically-expressed as a higher-order complex function, and as a result it can be used to predict Honkai fluctuations at the sub-atomic scale. Therefore, current researchers generally suspect that this “imaginary internal energy” is Honkai energy, or at least a major constituent of it.</p>

                <p class="article-text-h">Note: </p>
                <p class="article-text">The Old Faithful is the most popular geyser in the world. The volume of each spray is between 3700 gallons and 8400 gallons, and the water temperature is about 95°C.</p>
                <p class="article-text">“Old Faithful is sometimes degraded by being made a laundry. Garments placed in the crater during quiescence are ejected thoroughly washed when the eruption takes place. Gen. Sheridan's men, in 1882, found that linen and cotton fabrics were uninjured by the action of the water, but woolen clothes were torn to shreds.” (Translator's note: taken from “The Yellowstone National Park — A Manual for Tourists” by Henry Winser, 1883 — as cited in the Old Faithful Wikipedia article.)</p>

            <speak chara="teslaNoFace">What a coincidence that we can actually see it!</speak>
            <speak chara="nokiaNoFace">Oh my, oh my, we've definitely hit the jackpot.</speak>
            <speak chara="einNoFace"> … Winter is indeed much more spectacular than summer.</speak>
            <speak chara="planckNoFace">Although this attraction is named “Old Faithful” because it is very punctual, it actually has two intervals!</speak>
            <speak chara="planckNoFace">65 minutes and 91 minutes — the exact interval is said to depend on the size of each eruption.</speak>
            <speak chara="weltNoFace">Eh … then we — </speak>
            <speak chara="planckNoFace">So how about that, aren't we all very lucky today?</speak>
            <speak chara="schroNoFace"> … Professor, please stop being a tease. This was no dumb luck.</speak>
            <speak chara="schroNoFace">Especially given that the park forecasts and updates the eruption times every day.</speak>
            <speak chara="planckNoFace"> … </speak>
            <speak chara="planckNoFace">Schrödinger … Always, no matter the situation, you just say something, anything, and all sense of mystery and wonder is dispelled … </speak>
            <speak chara="schroNoFace">Thank you. That is indeed my strength.</speak>
