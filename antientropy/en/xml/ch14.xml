                <p class="article-text">The Maunsell Forts are a series of a mass-produced air defense towers built by the British at the mouth of the Rivers Thames and Mersey during World War II. (Translator's note: the Maunsell forts are located far from Southend-on-sea, on the other side of south-east England, so some artistic license is used here.)</p>
                <p class="article-text">The structure of a marine fort is similar to that of an anti-aircraft battery on land. The difference is that it is built on tall stilts atop a concrete barge. After the fort is assembled in the dock, it is towed by a tug to the designated area in the sea, then the concrete barge is scuttled, firmly anchoring the fort's foundation to the seafloor. </p>
                <p class="article-text">After World War II, the forts were abandoned. Among them, “HM Fort Roughs”, located on the open sea east of the County of Suffolk, was occupied by the family of army veteran Paddy Roy Bates on September 2, 1967. Furthermore, they proclaimed “independence” under international law as the “Principality of Sealand”. Although this declaration is considered by the international community to have no legitimacy, it has become an amusing case in the application of international law. (Translator's note: HM Fort Roughs was misspelled as HMS Fort Rough in the Chinese text. The Fort is not a ship so HMS is the wrong prefix.) </p>

It became α because it was originally the Polaris or North Star five thousand years ago.) (Translator note: The original Chinese text has the naming system the other way around, “Constellation name + Greek letter”, and describes it as such. This is likely a stylistic choice to mirror the Ancient Chinese nomenclature.)</p>

About 2.5 million light-years away from Earth, it is an extragalatic galaxy with a mass about twice that of the Milky Way.
